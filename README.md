# Gem Codebreaker for RubyGarage v.0.1.0

Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker.
The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.

Or install it yourself as:

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
